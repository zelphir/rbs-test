## Setup
If you didn't run `yarn` in the root as specified in the main `README` you can still run it here.

### Tests
Run `yarn test` to run the test. You can also run the tests in watch mode runnin `yarn test:watch` or `yarn test --watch`. To see the test coverage run `yarn test --coverage`. All the tests are using the `jest` framework.

### Build
Simply run `yarn build`, this will generate an optimized and minified version of the app.
